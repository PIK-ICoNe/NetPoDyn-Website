In view of the challenges of the energy transition, and in particular the upcoming change from synchronous machines to
grid-forming inverters, methodological research on the collective dynamics of power grids is highly topical Existing 
simulation environments are often not state of the art in terms of numerical methods and the use of high-performance 
computing (HPC) and GPUs This prevents their use in large sampling studies, which are necessary for the use of machine 
learning (ML), for example Furthermore, methodological and mathematical advances are often difficult or impossible to 
implement in existing software, which means they cannot be validated on realistic models and ultimately do not make it
into practice For methodological research, the flexibility of the implementation of models, as well as the performance 
of simulations, is crucial The use of A1 and ML requires large amounts of simulation data as input In order to even
enter research on hybrid Al methods that directly combine physical simulations and ML, it is necessary to implement
the models in programming languages conceptualized for this purpose Existing software tools also reach performance
limits in practice Due to the limited performance of today's simulation software, not all potentially relevant
contingencies can be considered in time-critical situations This project aims to close this gap by developing a
software suite designed to quickly and effectively integrate methodological innovations while being able to simulate
realistic dynamic models of the power grid PIK's tasks include coordination of the project, community building and
workshops, training materials and tutorials, development of backend and frontend, and initial research as model studies.
